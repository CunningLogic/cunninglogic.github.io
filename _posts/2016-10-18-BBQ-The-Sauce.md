title: BBQ, The Sauce
---

Someone from /r/netsec complained that the lack of BBQ related posts on my blog was disappointing. They were right, I failed you all. I promised BBQ and 0days and haven't delivered fully on that. I promised the redditor to make it up with a post on pulled pork, however the weather has hampered that plan. I do have friends coming to visit for a weekend of hacking & BBQ, and sauce needs to age a bit before it is ready so let's do this. I will do a pulled pork post rain or shine on Friday.

Warning!
Sauce does not make BBQ. You can not slap some sauce on meat and claim you have BBQ. Sauce compliments BBQ, it does not make BBQ good. If your meat is not good enough to over stuff yourself on without sauce, then just throw it the dogs. BBQ takes pork, rub, smoke, time and love. Sauce is just an extra kicker!

This sauce is a North Carolina inspired mop sauce, a thin tomato and apple cider vinegar based sauce. It doesn't have to be used as a mop sauce, and works great right on top of your pulled pork. It makes a very good fry sauce when mixed 60/40 with mayonnaise. This sauce is a variation on a low carbohydrate sauce from [The Wolfe Pit](http://www.thewolfepit.com/2016/05/homemade-bbq-sauce-low-carb-recipe.html) with some variations to fit my tastes. Don't let the words low carb deter you. I started making this when I was doing the low carb thing, I kept making it as is because it is damn good. This recipe makes about 2 & 1/3 cups, depending on how thin you want it. I BBQ for a lot of people, and always have a wide variety of sauces, this is always the favorite (I suggest not mentioning it is low carb! Those words scare people!).


ingredients:

- 16oz Tomato Sauce
- 4oz Apple Cider Vinegar
- 60g Stevia
- 3TBS Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce (American variation, Canadian & European variants differ!)
- 2TBS Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard
- 2TBS Chipotle Tabasco Sauce
- 1TBS Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice
- 1TBS Fresh Ground Black Pepper
- Pinch of Salt

The quality of your ingredient always reflects in the quality of your product. When important, I have mentioned the brand I use. 


First step is to combine all the ingredients, squeeze the lemon and grind the pepper last. Using store bought lemon juice or pre-ground pepper is lame, and it won't come out the same. If you plan to put the sauce in a squirt bottle, make sure the black pepper is finely ground or you risk clogging the nozzle on the bottle.

Apply heat, stir all the ingredients together and bring to a boil.

Once the sauce has started to boil, cut the heat low and simmer the sauce for 5-15 minutes depending on how thick you want the sauce. A proper mop sauce is quite thin, but you may continue to cook for a thicker sauce. Make sure you keep stirring the sauce to avoid burning it!

When the thickness is to your preference, place the sauce in a glass container (sauce will stain soft plastics when hot), and age in your refrigerator for at least 24 hours.

Enjoy!
