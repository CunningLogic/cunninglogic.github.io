title: Pork Explosion Realities
---

With the media <s>ignoring everything about it</s> frenzy from yesterday’s announcement of Pork Explosion, we thought we would <s>release some more hype</s> clear up some misconceptions.

Pork Explosion is real, the realities are so <s>overhyped</s> scary that you won’t believe it. 

It can gain execution on a phone without installing an app, enabling usb debugging, or visiting a webpage. No faraday cage can protect you from the Pork Explosion.

It can be used to root the phone, exfiltrate confidential data, bypass code-signing, bypass dm-verity, bypass lock screens, brute force encryption keys and yes even completely circumvent the ever powerful NSA <s>backdoor</s> Linux Kernel security extension called SELinux.

Fear the Pork.
